# DAA-Assignments
## Assignment 1 Question :

Take a 10 x 10 matrix (n x n in general) filled with English alphabets. Trace the longest sorted partition:-

a) in each row of the matrix

b) in each diagonal of the matrix.

## Assignment 2 Question :

In a randomly generated square matrix of size n x n (for a given value of n), locate a particular key without sorting. Do the

necessary experimentation and analysis with your algorithm.

## Assignment 3 Question :

Write an efficient algorithm to achieve the following. Given a set of numbers, find out the smallest and the largest numbers in

the list. Swap the smallest with the first element and largest with the last element. Find the second smallest and second

largest and swap them with their proper positions. Continue in this way until all the elements are sorted. Track the movement

of every element in the list while sorting. Do the necessary experimentation and analysis with your algorithm. 

## Assignment 4 Question :

Write an efficient algorithm to traverse from node i to node j in a given complete binary tree. Note that i and j values are

given as input to your algorithm (in addition to the tree). Do the necessary experimentation and analysis with your algorithm. 

## Assignment 5 Question :

Given a set of numbers, write an efficient algorithm, using Heap Sort, to report the k'th largest element of the Heap for

some given input value of k. Trace the content of every node of the Heap during the execution of your algorithm.
